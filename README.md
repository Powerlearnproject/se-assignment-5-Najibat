The installer will now copy all necessary files to your system. This might take a few minutes, so be patient. 
Step 13: Launch Visual Studio Code
Once the installation is complete, check the box to launch Visual Studio Code, then click "Finish".
You can also launch it later from the Start Menu or desktop icon if you created one. 
After completing these steps, Visual Studio Code will open, and you can start customizing it with extensions and settings to fit your needs.


2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.

Anwser to setting up a vs code

1. User and Workspace Settings 
You can configure Visual Studio Code to your liking through its various settings. Nearly every part of VS Code's editor, user interface, and functional behavior has options you can modify.
VS Code provides different scopes for settings:
User settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
Workspace settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.
 we'll first describe user settings as these are your personal settings for customizing VS Code. Later we'll cover Workspace settings, which will be specific to the project you're working on.
Settings editor
Use the Settings editor to review and change VS Code settings. To open the Settings editor, navigate to File > Preferences (Code > Preferences or Code > Settings on macOS) > Settings. Alternately, open the Settings editor from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) with Preferences: Open Settings or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+,).
When you open the Settings editor, you can search and discover the settings you are looking for. When you search using the search bar, it not only shows and highlights the settings matching your criteria, but also filter out those which are not matching. This makes finding settings quick and easy.

Changes to settings are applied directly by VS Code, as you change them. Modified settings are indicated with a blue line, similar to modified lines in the editor.
In the example below, the Side Bar location and File Icon Theme were changed.

The gear icon (More Actions... Shift+F9) opens a context menu with options to reset a setting to its default value, and to copy the setting ID or copy a JSON name-value pair.

Edit settings
Each setting can be edited by either a checkbox, an text input field, or a dropdown. Edit the text or select the option you want to change to the desired settings.

Settings groups
Settings are represented in groups, so that you can navigate to them easily. There is a Commonly Used group at the top, which shows popular customizations.
In the following example, the source control settings are focused by selecting Source Control in the tree view.

Note: VS Code extensions can also add their own custom settings, and those settings are visible under an Extensions section.
Changing a setting
As an example, let's hide the Activity Bar from VS Code. You might want to hide the Activity Bar to give the editor a little more room, or if you prefer to open views via the View menu or Command Palette.
Open the Settings Editor (Ctrl+,) and type "activity" in the search bar.

You can further limit the scope to just those settings under the Appearance group in the table of contents on the left. There should now be just three settings.
You can now check and uncheck the Workbench > Activity Bar: Visible setting to hide and unhide the Activity Bar. Notice that when you have changed the setting value to be different than the default value, you see a blue line to the left.

You can always reset a setting to the default value by hovering over a setting to show the gear icon, clicking on the gear icon, and then selecting the Reset Setting action.
Settings editor filters
The Settings editor search bar has several filters to make it easier to manage your settings. To the right of the search bar is a filter button with a funnel icon that provides options to easily add a filter to the search bar.
Modified settings
To check which settings you have configured, there is a @modified filter in the search bar. A setting shows up under this filter if its value differs from the default value, or if its value is explicitly set in the respective settings JSON file.
This filter can be useful if you have forgotten whether you configured a setting, or if the editor is not behaving as you expect because you accidentally configured a setting.

Other filters
There are several other handy filters to help with searching through settings. Type the @ symbol in the search bar to discover the different filters.

Extension settings
Installed VS Code extensions can also contribute their own settings, which you can review under the Extensions section of the Settings editor.

You can also review an extension's settings from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) by selecting the extension and reviewing the Feature Contributions tab.


3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

1. Answer to user interface

 The User Interface
Let’s first get acquainted with the user interface: 

Visual Studio Code’s user interface is divided into five main areas which you can easily adjust. 
a. Activity Bar: allows you to switch between views: explorer, search, version control, debug and extensions.
b. Side Bar: contains the active view.
Editor: this is where you edit files and preview markdown files. You can arrange multiple open files side-by-side.
c. Panel: displays different panels: integrated terminal, output panels for debug information, errors and warnings.
d. Status: displays information about the currently opened project and file. Also contains buttons for executing version control actions, and enabling/disabling extension features.
There’s also the top Menu Bar where you can access the editor’s menu system. For Linux users, the default integrated terminal will probably be the Bash shell. For Windows users, it’s PowerShell. Fortunately, there’s a shell selector located inside the terminal dropdown that will allow you to choose a different shell. If installed, you can choose any of the following: 
Command Prompt
PowerShell
PowerShell Core
Git Bash
WSL


4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

1. Answer to Command Palette

The Command Palette in VS Code is a feature that allows users to quickly find and execute command. The Command Palette can be used for various tasks, such as transforming selected text into title case1, depending on the plugins and commands available.

The Command Palette in Visual Studio Code enables users to swiftly find and apply commands.
Accessing the Command Palette can be achieved through View > Command Palette or by using keyboard shortcuts Cmd–Shift–P (Mac) or Ctrl–Shift–P (Windows).
The Command Palette can be utilized to transform selected text into title case.
Users can find specific commands by typing in relevant keywords or acronyms into the Command Palette.
The Command Palette allows for the execution of a wide range of commands, including transformation and selection functions.
Some useful commands for users include 'Sort Lines Ascending', 'Sort Lines Descending', and 'Update Image Size'.

Using the Command Palette
VS Code’s Command Palette lets you quickly find and apply commands. To open the Command Palette, choose View > Command Palette or hit Cmd–Shift–P (Mac) or Ctrl–Shift–P (Windows).
Here’s an example of how to use it:
Select some text that you want to convert into title case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized).
Hit Cmd–Shift–P (Mac) or Ctrl–Shift–P (Windows) to open the Command Palette.
Start typing title until Transform to Title Case appears and is selected. (If needed, use the Down/Up Arrow keys to move the selection down or up.)
NOTE: You can also find this command by typing ttt (for transform to title case) because the search is very good at matching!
Hit Return (Mac) or Enter (Windows) to execute the command.
Some Useful Commands are 
a. Sort Lines Ascending or Sort Lines Descending 
b. Update Image Size

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

Answer to Debugging in VS code

Debugging in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful feature that can help you identify and fix issues in your code. Here are the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program:

Open Your File:
Open the file you want to debug in VS Code. For example, if you’re debugging a JavaScript program, open the relevant .js file.
Run and Debug View:
Click the “Run and Debug” icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code (or use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘D on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+D on Windows/Linux).
This view displays information related to running and debugging, including debugging commands and configuration settings.
Create a Launch Configuration (Optional):
While you can run your active file directly, creating a launch configuration file is beneficial for most debugging scenarios.
VS Code keeps debugging configuration details in a launch.json file located in a .vscode folder within your workspace (project root folder).
To create a launch.json file:
Click “Create a launch.json file” in the Run start view.
VS Code will try to detect your debug environment automatically, but you can choose it manually if needed.
Example launch.json for Node.js debugging:
JSON

{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": ["<node_internals/**"],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
        }
    ]
}

Set Breakpoints:
Set breakpoints in your code where you want to pause execution and inspect variables or expressions.
Click the left margin next to the line number to add a breakpoint.
Start Debugging:
Press F5 or click the green play button in the top bar.
VS Code will run your program and pause at the breakpoints you’ve set.
Use the debugging toolbar to step through your code, inspect variables, and analyze the output.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) offers robust debugging features that can significantly enhance your development workflow. Here are some key aspects of VS Code’s debugging capabilities:

Built-in Debugger:
VS Code includes an interactive debugger that allows you to step through source code, inspect variables, view call stacks, and execute commands in the console1.
It supports debugging for the Node.js runtime and can handle JavaScript, TypeScript, and other languages transpiled to JavaScript.
Debugger Extensions:
For languages and runtimes beyond Node.js, you can find additional debugger extensions in the VS Code Marketplace.
These extensions cover various languages, including PHP, Ruby, Go, C#, Python, C++, PowerShell, and more1.
Launch Configurations:
Creating a launch.json file is beneficial for most debugging scenarios.
It allows you to configure and save debugging setup details, such as specifying the entry point, environment variables, and other options.
VS Code keeps these configurations in the .vscode folder within your workspace1.
Run and Debug View:
Access the Run and Debug view by clicking the icon in the Activity Bar or using the shortcut ⇧⌘D (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+D).
This view displays information related to running and debugging, including top bar commands and configuration settings1.
Breakpoints:
Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code.
Inspect variables, examine call stacks, and analyze exceptions while debugging.
Step Over, Run to Cursor, and Restart:
Step over code to skip functions, run to a specific cursor position, or quickly restart your app during debugging.
Variable Inspection and Data Tips:
Inspect variables interactively using data tips.
Hover over variables to see their values during debugging2.
Watch Expressions:
Set watch expressions to monitor specific variables or expressions continuously.
VS Code evaluates these expressions as you step through the code.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

Answer to Using source Control

 1. To integrate Git with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for version control, follow these steps:

Install Git: Make sure you have Git installed on your machine. VS Code will use your system’s Git installation (at least version 2.0.0). If you haven’t installed Git yet, do so before proceeding.
Open a Project in VS Code: Open your project folder in VS Code. If you’re starting a new project, create a new folder and open it in VS Code.
Initialize a Git Repository:
Click the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the left (it looks like a branch).
Select “Initialize Repository” to create a new Git repository in your project folder.
Stage and Commit Changes:
Make changes to your files.
Click the “+” icon next to each file in the Source Control view to stage changes.
Enter a commit message and press Ctrl+Enter (macOS: ⌘+Enter) to commit the changes.
Create and Switch Branches:
Use the “Git: Create Branch” command to create a new branch.
Use the “Git: Checkout to …” command to switch between branches.
View Changes and Merge:
Compare changes between branches.
Merge commits from one branch into another.

2. The process of initializing a Git repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub:

Initialize a Repository:
To start a new project with Git, you can either use git init or git clone. Choose one, not both.
If you’re starting a new repository locally, use git init. This command creates a hidden directory called .git in your project folder, which stores Git-related information.
Example:
git init

Add Files and Make Commits:
After initializing the repository, add your project files using git add.
Then, create a commit (a snapshot of your changes) with git commit -m "Your commit message".
Example:
git add .  # Add all files
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Create a Remote Repository on GitHub:
Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository.
Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git).
Link Local and Remote Repositories:
In your local repository, set the remote URL using:
git remote add origin <repository_url>

Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL you copied from GitHub.
Push Changes to GitHub:
Push your local commits to the remote repository using:
git push -u origin main

The -u flag sets up tracking so that future pushes can be done with just git push.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
